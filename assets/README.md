# Assets Directory

Place the following files in this directory for proper app configuration:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024 px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon foreground
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

For development, you can use placeholder images or generate them using:
- Expo CLI: `npx expo install expo-dev-client` and use development build
- Online generators for app icons and splash screens

Note: The app will work without these assets during development, but they are required for production builds.
